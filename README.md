## Details

### select

`select` is always needed. An array of keys should be passed.

### from

`from` is always needed. A single object or an array of objects is needed. The objects should have the keys listed in `select`.

### where

`where` can be used to give a condition. The condition should look like `key operator operand`(2 spaces are necessary). Currently, 5 operators (`>`, `>=`, `=`, `<`, `<=`) are supported.

### order

`order` can be used to order the result objects by a key. `asc` or `desc` should be passed as a second value.

### run

`run` is used to finish the query and get the results.
